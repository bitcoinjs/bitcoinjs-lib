__fixed__
- Updated bip174 dependency to fix issue with unknownKeyVals. (#1979)

# 6.1.4
__changed__
- Changed internal usage of the Buffer API to match with newer broken bundlers that don't follow spec. The new usage is still compatible with older versions of Buffer, so there shouldn't be any breakage. The public API interface was not changed. (#1975)

# 6.1.3
__fixed__
- validateSignaturesOfInput for taproot inputs returned false for valid signatures in specific cases. (#1934)

# 6.1.2
__fixed__
- validateSignaturesOfInput for taproot inputs returned true for invalid signatures in specific cases. (#1932)

# 6.1.1
__added__
- add example using BIP86 vector to verify the sending to and from a BIP86 generated taproot address

__fixed__
- support for 65 byte taproot signature
- prevent the creation of unspendable scripts in bitcoinjs-lib by implementing checks for resource limitations
- use `Buffer.from()` instead of `Buffer.of()`

__changed__
- performance: precompute the taproot hashes
- performance: switch from `create-hash` and `ripemd160` to noble-hashes

__removed__
- types: removed unused methods `privateAdd` and `privateNegate` from `TinySecp256k1Interface`

# 6.1.0
__added__
- taproot support for payments (p2tr) and PSBT. See taproot.spec.ts integration test for examples. (#1742)

# 6.0.2
__fixed__
- p2sh payment now uses empty Buffer for redeem.output when redeemScript is OP_FALSE (#1802)
- Fix ripemd160 hashing fallback issue (#1812)

# 6.0.1
- No changes to public API

# 6.0.0
__removed__
- bip32: Removed the re-export. Please add as dependency to your app instead.
- ECPair: Please use bip32 moving forward. ecpair package was created for those who need it.
- TransactionBuilder: Any internal files used only in TB (classify, templates, etc.) were also removed.

__added__
- taproot segwit v1 address support (bech32m) via address module (#1676)
- hashForWitnessV1 method on Transaction class (#1745)

__fixed__
- Transaction version read/write differed. (#1717)

# 5.2.0
__changed__
- Updated PSBT to allow for witnessUtxo and nonWitnessUtxo simultaneously (Re: segwit psbt bug) (#1563)

__added__
- PSBT methods `getInputType`, `inputHasPubkey`, `inputHasHDKey`, `outputHasPubkey`, `outputHasHDKey` (#1563)

# 5.1.10
__fixed__
- Fixed psbt.signInputAsync (and consequentially all Async signing methods) not handling rejection of keypair.sign properly (#1582)

# 5.1.9
__fixed__
- Fixed errors for psbt.txOutputs getter (#1578)

# 5.1.8
__fixed__
- Throw errors when p2wsh or p2wpkh contain uncompressed pubkeys (#1573)

__added__
- Add txInputs and txOutputs for Psbt (#1561)

__changed__
- (Not exposed) Added BufferWriter to help ease maintenance of certain forks of this library (#1533)

# 5.1.7
__fixed__
- Fixed Transaction class Output interface typing for TypeScript (#1506)
- Add `weight()` to Block class, add optional includeWitness arg to Transaction byteLength method (#1515)
- Match the old TransactionBuilder behavior of allowing for multiple instances of the same pubkey to be in a p2ms script for PSBT (#1519)

__added__
- Allow the API consumer to pass in the finalizer functions to allow for any type of transaction to be finalized. It places the most crucial part of transaction construction on the consumer, and should be used with caution. (#1491)

# 5.1.6
__fixed__
- `PsbtOutputExtended` did not support using the address attribute properly. It is now fixed.

# 5.1.5
__added__
- `Psbt` now has `getFee(): number` for use when all inputs are finalized. It returns the satoshi fee of the transaction. Calling getFee, getFeeRate, or extractTransaction will cache these values so if you call one after the other, the second call will return immediately.

# 5.1.4
__changed__
- `Psbt` inputs using segwit scripts can now work with nonWitnessUtxo as well as the original witnessUtxo. The reasoning for this is that nonWitnessUtxo has all the information contained in the witnessUtxo, so rejecting signing even though we have all the info we need is unnecessary. Trying to sign a non-segwit script with a witnessUtxo will still throw an Error as it should.

# 5.1.3
__changed__
- TypeScript types: Made Signer and SignerAsync use any for network since we only check for equivalence. (#1448)
- TypeScript types: Made the args for addInput and addOutput for Psbt actually accept updateInput and updateOutput parameters. (#1449)

# 5.1.2
__added__
- `ECPair` and `bip32` objects now have a lowR boolean attribute defaulted to false. You may set it to true to ensure that the sign method uses low R values (#1442) (This is to enable low R usage in Psbt, since we decided not to give the low R flag to the Psbt class, since it makes more sense to be an attribute of the Signer interface)

# 5.1.1
__changed__
- Name inconsistencies for Psbt class. (Quick fix)

# 5.1.0
__added__
- A new `Psbt` class for creating, distributing, combining, signing, and compiling Transactions (#1425)
- A `name` attribute to the Payment interface. P2SH and P2WSH are nested with `'-'` as separator, and p2ms is in the format of `'p2ms(m of n)''` all others are just hard coded. (#1433)

__changed__
- `TransactionBuilder`: Migrate to stricter type checks during sign by switching to a single object parameter (#1416)
- `tests`: Use regtest-client as separate library (#1421)

# 5.0.5
__added__
- Added `ECPairInterface` `Stack` and `StackElement` interfaces to the main index.ts export (TypeScript only affected)

# 5.0.4
__added__

- `Block.calculateMerkleRoot` now has `forWitness?: boolean` which when true returns the witness commit (a652d04)

__removed__
- `Block.prototype.checkMerkleRoot` was removed, please use `checkTxRoots` (0426c66)

# 4.0.5
__fixed__
- Fixed bug where Angular apps break due to lack of crypto at build time. Reverted #1373 and added (6bead5d).

# 4.0.4
__fixed__
- Fixed bug where Electron v4 breaks due to lack of `'rmd160'` alias for ripemd160 hash. (#1373)

# 4.0.3
__fixed__

- Fixed `payments.p2sh`, which now takes the network from the redeem attribute if one is not given in the object argument (#1232)
- Fixed `Block.calculateTarget` to allow for exponents up to 29 (#1285)
- Fixed some low priority rarely occurring bugs with multisig payments and `TransactionBuilder` multisig processing (#1307)

__changed__
- `ECPair.prototype.sign` now returns a 64-byte signature `Buffer`, not an `ECSignature` object (#1084)
- `ECPair` (and all ECDSA code) now uses [`tiny-secp256k1`](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/tiny-secp256k1), which uses the [`libsecp256k1` library](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1) (#1070)
- `TransactionBuilder` internal variables are now `__` prefixed to discourage public usage (#1038)
- `TransactionBuilder` now defaults to version 2 transaction versions (#1036)

# 2.1.0
From this release users should use the HDNode directly (compared to accessing `.keyPair`) when performing ECDSA operations such as `sign` or `verify`.
Ideally you should not have to directly access `HDNode` internals for general usage,  as it can often be confusing and error prone.

__added__
- `ECPair.prototype.getNetwork`
- `HDNode.prototype.getNetwork`, wraps the underlying keyPair's `getNetwork` method
- `HDNode.prototype.getPublicKeyBuffer`, wraps the underlying keyPair's `getPublicKeyBuffer` method
- `HDNode.prototype.sign`, wraps the underlying keyPair's `sign` method
- `HDNode.prototype.verify`, wraps the underlying keyPair's `verify` method


# 2.0.0
In this release we have strived to simplify the API,  [using native types](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/issues/407) wherever possible to encourage cross-compatibility with other open source community modules.

The `ecdsa` module has been removed in lieu of using a new ECDSA module (for performance and safety reasons) during the `2.x.y` major release.
Several other cumbersome modules have been removed,  with their new independent modules recommended for usage instead for greater modularity in your projects.

-----------------------------

Backward incompatible changes:

__added__
- export `address`, for `address` based [utility functions](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/master/src/address.js), most compatible, just without `Address` instantiation, see #401, #444
- export `script`, for `script` based [utility functions](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/master/src/script.js), mostly compatible, just without `Script` instantiation, see #438, #444
- export `ECPair`, a merged replacement for `ECKey`/`ECPubKey`, invalid types will throw via `typeforce`

__changed__
- `address.toOutputScript`, `ECPair.prototype.fromWIF` and `HDNode.prototype.fromBase58` no longer automatically detect the network, `networks.bitcoin` is always assumed unless given.
- `assert` was used for type checking, now replaced by `typeforce`
- `BIP66` compliant strict DER signature validation was added to `ECSignature.fromDER`, changing the exact exception messages slightly, see #448.

- `new HDNode(d/Q, chainCode, network)` -> `new HDNode(keyPair, chainCode)`, now uses `ECPair`
- `HDNode.prototype.toBase58(false)` -> `HDNode.prototype.neutered().toBase58()` for exporting an extended public key
- `HDNode.prototype.toBase58(true)` -> `HDNode.prototype.toBase58()` for exporting an extended private key

- `Transaction.prototype.hashForSignature(prevOutScript, inIndex, hashType)` -> `Transaction.prototype.hashForSignature(inIndex, prevOutScript, hashType)`
- `Transaction.prototype.addInput(hash, ...)`: `hash` could be a string, Transaction or Buffer -> `hash` can now **only** be a `Buffer`.
- `Transaction.prototype.addOutput(scriptPubKey, ...)`: `scriptPubKey ` could be a string, `Address` or a `Buffer` -> `scriptPubKey` can now **only** be a `Buffer`.
- `TransactionBuilder` API unchanged.

__removed__
- export `Address`, `strings` are now used,  benchwith no performance loss for most use cases
- export `base58check`, use [`bs58check`](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bs58check) instead
- export `ecdsa`, use [`ecurve`](https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/ecurve) instead
- export `ECKey`, use new export `ECPair` instead
- export `ECPubKey`, use new export `ECPair` instead
- export `Wallet`, see README.md#complementing-libraries instead
- export `Script`, use new utility export `script` instead (#438 for more information)

- `crypto.HmacSHA256 `, use [node crypto](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html) instead
- `crypto.HmacSHA512 `, use [node crypto](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html) instead

- `Transaction.prototype.sign`, use `TransactionBuilder.prototype.sign`
- `Transaction.prototype.signInput`, use `TransactionBuilder.prototype.sign`
- `Transaction.prototype.validateInput`, use `Transaction.prototype.hashForSignature` and `ECPair.verify`

- `HDNode.fromBuffer`, use `HDNode.fromBase58` instead
- `HDNode.fromHex`, use `HDNode.fromBase58` instead
- `HDNode.toBuffer`, use `HDNode.prototype.toBase58` instead
- `HDNode.toHex`, use `HDNode.prototype.toBase58` instead

- `networks.*.magic`, see the comment [here](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/pull/432/files#r36715792)
- `networks.[viacoin|viacointestnet|gamerscoin|jumbucks|zetacoin]`, import these yourself (see #383/a0e6ee7)
- `networks.*.estimateFee`, out-dated

__renamed__
- `Message` -> `message`
- `scripts` -> `script`
- `scripts.dataOutput ` -> `script.nullDataOutput` (per [convention](https://org/en/glossary/null-data-transaction))
