The pure JavaScript Bitcoin library for node.js and browsers.
Used by over a million wallet users and the backbone for almost all Bitcoin web wallets in production today.


## Features

- Clean: Pure JavaScript, concise code, easy to read.
- Tested: Coverage > 90%, third-party integration tests.
- Careful: Two person approval process for small, focused pull requests.
- Compatible: Works on Node.js and all modern browsers.
- Powerful: Support for advanced features, such as multi-sig, HD Wallets.
- Secure: Strong random number generation, PGP signed releases, trusted developers.
- Principled: No support for browsers with crap RNG (IE < 11)
- Standardized: Node community coding style, Browserify, Node's stdlib and Buffers.
- Fast: Optimized code, uses typed arrays instead of byte arrays for performance.
- Experiment-friendly: Bitcoin Mainnet and Testnet support.
- Altcoin-ready: Capable of working with bitcoin-derived cryptocurrencies (such as Dogecoin).


## Should I use this in production?

If you are thinking of using the master branch of this library in production, **stop**.
Master is not stable; it is our development branch, and [only tagged releases may be classified as stable](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/tags).


## Installation

`npm install bitcoinjs-lib`


## Setup

### Node.js

    var bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib')


### Browser

If you're familiar with how to use browserify, ignore this and proceed normally.
These steps are advisory only,  and may not be necessary for your application.

[Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) is assumed to be installed for these steps.

From your repository, create an `index.js` file
``` javascript
module.exports = {
  base58: require('bs58'),
  bitcoin: require('bitcoinjs-lib'),
  ecurve: require('ecurve'),
  BigInteger: require('bigi')
}
```

Install each of the above packages locally
``` bash
npm install bs58 bitcoinjs-lib ecurve bigi
```

After installation, use browserify to compile `index.js` for use in the browser:
``` bash
    $ browserify index.js --standalone foo > app.js
```

You will now be able to use `<script src="app.js" />` in your browser, with each of the above exports accessible via the global `foo` object (or whatever you chose for the `--standalone` parameter above).

**NOTE**: See our package.json for the currently supported version of browserify used by this repository.

**NOTE**: When uglifying the javascript, you must exclude the following variable names from being mangled: `Array`, `BigInteger`, `Boolean`, `ECPair`, `Function`, `Number`, `Point` and `Script`.
This is because of the function-name-duck-typing used in [typeforce](https://github.com/dcousens/typeforce).
Example:
``` bash
uglifyjs ... --mangle --reserved 'Array,BigInteger,Boolean,ECPair,Function,Number,Point'
```

**NOTE**: If you expect this library to run on an iOS 10 device, ensure that you are using [buffer@5.0.5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/buffer) or greater.

### Flow

Definitions for [Flow typechecker](https://flowtype.org/) are available in flow-typed repository.

[You can either download them directly](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed/blob/master/definitions/npm/bitcoinjs-lib_v2.x.x/flow_v0.17.x-/bitcoinjs-lib_v2.x.x.js) from the repo, or with the flow-typed CLI

    # npm install -g flow-typed
    $ flow-typed install -f 0.27 bitcoinjs-lib@2.2.0 # 0.27 for flow version, 2.2.0 for bitcoinjs-lib version

The definitions are complete and up to date with version 2.2.0. The definitions are maintained by [@runn1ng](https://github.com/runn1ng).
