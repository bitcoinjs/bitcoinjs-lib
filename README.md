The pure JavaScript Bitcoin library for node.js and browsers.
Used by over a million wallet users and the backbone for almost all Bitcoin web wallets in production today.


## Features

- Clean: Pure JavaScript, concise code, easy to read.
- Tested: Coverage > 90%, third-party integration tests.
- Careful: Two person approval process for small, focused pull requests.
- Compatible: Works on Node.js and all modern browsers.
- Powerful: Support for advanced features, such as multi-sig, HD Wallets.
- Secure: Strong random number generation, PGP signed releases, trusted developers.
- Principled: No support for browsers with crap RNG (IE < 11)
- Standardized: Node community coding style, Browserify, Node's stdlib and Buffers.
- Fast: Optimized code, uses typed arrays instead of byte arrays for performance.
- Experiment-friendly: Bitcoin Mainnet and Testnet support.
- Altcoin-ready: Capable of working with bitcoin-derived cryptocurrencies (such as Dogecoin).


## Should I use this in production?

If you are thinking of using the master branch of this library in production, **stop**.
Master is not stable; it is our development branch, and [only tagged releases may be classified as stable](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/tags).


## Installation

`npm install bitcoinjs-lib`


## Setup

### Node.js

    var bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib')


### Browser

If you're familiar with how to use browserify, ignore this and proceed normally.
These steps are advisory only and allow you to use the API to its full extent.

[Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) is assumed to be installed for these steps.

From your repository, create a `foobar.js` file

``` javascript
var foobar = {
  base58: require('bs58'),
  bitcoin: require('bitcoinjs-lib'),
  ecurve: require('ecurve'),
  BigInteger: require('bigi'),
  Buffer: require('buffer')
}

module.exports = foobar
```

Each of these included packages are seperate to `bitcoinjs-lib`, and must be installed separately.
They are however used in the bitcoinjs-lib public API.

Using browserify, compile `foo.js` for use in the browser:

    $ browserify foo.js -s foobar > bar.js

You will then be able to load `bar.js` into your browser, with each of the dependencies above accessible from the global `foobar` object.

**NOTE**: See our package.json for the currently supported version of browserify used by this repository.

**NOTE**: When uglifying the javascript, you must exclude the following variable names from being mangled: `Array`, `BigInteger`, `Boolean`, `Buffer`, `ECPair`, `Function`, `Number`, `Point` and `Script`.
This is because of the function-name-duck-typing used in [typeforce](https://github.com/dcousens/typeforce).
Example:
``` bash
uglifyjs ... --mangle --reserved 'Array,BigInteger,Boolean,Buffer,ECPair,Function,Number,Point'
```
